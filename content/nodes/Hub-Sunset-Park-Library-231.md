Sunset Park Library is located in the Sunset Park neibourhood of Brooklyn. It is a new construction (as of early 2023) to serve as a library and affordable housing building. The bottom floor is a Library, with apartment units above.

In March of 2023, we began work installing a community hub on the library. The library has Line-Of-Sight to SN3, along with the majority of the surrounding area, extending mesh covereage further south in Brooklyn.

## Infrastructure

The site currently hosts 2 antenna masts on the upper roof of the building.
There is a AF24 Point-to-Point(PtP) link back to SN3, 4 AirMax sector antennas for LiteBeam connections from the surrounding neibourhoods and a direct PtP link to Node 9382 full building install.

This site was also a testing ground for our upgraded and improve design philosophy for large hubs. We worked to ensure this design was solid, built correctly and could serve as a guide for future hub installations. 

The design includes proper grounding for all rooftop equipment, a power distribution system designed for future expansion and improved reliability and extra space included for future apartment and/or fiber connections.

The site currently has a CCR1009 main router, EdgePower DC supply and a NetPower 16P rooftop switch.
